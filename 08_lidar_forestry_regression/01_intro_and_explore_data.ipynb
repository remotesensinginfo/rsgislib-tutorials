    "# Forest Inventory with Airborne LiDAR\n",

    "Through this practical, you will use metrics derived from LiDAR point clouds to estimate stem volume (m3 ha-1), basal area (m2 ha-1), and diameter at breast height (DBH; cm). You have been provided with 166 forest plots dominated by Sitka spruce plantations.\n",

    "## LiDAR Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the volume of LiDAR required to cover the full area of this forest, it would be too much for you to process as part of this tutorial. Therefore, the LiDAR point cloud analysis has already been applied but consists of the following steps, which were applied using the SPDLib software:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Import the LAS/LAZ files into the SPD file format.\n",
    " 2. Filter noise from the point cloud\n",
    " 3. Classify ground returns\n",
    " 4. Populate point height field using the classified ground returns.\n",

    "### Defining the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Airborne LiDAR is a popular tool for forest inventory applications as it provides direct, high resolution measurements of canopy height and cover. However, airborne LiDAR cannot directly measure several important forest biometrics such as stem diameter, basal area, wood volume and biomass. To indirectly derive these forest biometrics from LiDAR measurements requires regression analysis using an area-based approach (White et al., 2013) or a single-tree approach (Breidenbach et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011). In the area-based approach, LiDAR measurements are spatially gridded and converted into a range of  metrics (height percentiles and density statistics) that quantify the vertical and horizontal distribution of laser returns within the forest canopy. The LiDAR metrics are then regressed against forest inventory measurements recorded at ground level in fixed-area plots. The final outcome of this procedure is a wall-to-wall map of estimated forest inventory attributes across the region surveyed by the airborne LiDAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with three files:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Forest_Plot_Metrics.csv** – The field plots with associated LiDAR forest metrics.\n",
    " 2. **Forest_ALS_Metrics.kea** – An image 20x20 m pixels with the LiDAR metrics for the whole forest area to which the regression relationships developed on the field plots will be applied providing stem volume (m3 ha-1), basal area (m2 ha-1) and DBH (cm) for the whole forest area. Note, this image has been masked to just the forest area.\n",
    " 3. **Forest_ALS_Valid.kea** - A binary image for the metrics image specifying which pixels should be used for processing (i.e., forest pixels). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our research challenge is to generate accurate predictions for all three of these response variables by using the LiDAR metrics as predictor variables. This challenge could be solved by predicting the values individually for each response variable through multiple regression (multiple predictors, one response variable). However, such an approach would not preserve the covariance/correlations between the response variables, therefore we will also use multivariate regression to predict all three response variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions underlying regression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether we are using parametric or non-parametric regression methods, there are several assumptions inherent to regression analysis:\n",
    " 1. There exists a non-random relationship between out predictor and response variable(s). For example, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression assumes a constant monotonic relationship between our predictor(s) and response(s).\n",
    " 2. Multicollinearity – the regression model should only contain predictor variables that are independent or exogeneous (i.e., they are not a function of predictor variables already present within the model).\n",
    " 3. Homoskedasticity – the residuals/errors derived from a regression model should have constant variance.\n",
    " 4. Normality – the residuals/errors derived from a regression model should be normally distributed (Gaussian). With larger training datasets, this assumption becomes less problematic as the residuals will naturally approximate a Gaussian distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n"
